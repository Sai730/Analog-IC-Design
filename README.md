*Project 1: Design of 3.2 GHz Phase-Locked Loop(PLL) | Cadence Virtuoso, 90 nm process*
* Designed an LC oscillator with 1 mW power consumption and -112 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 MHz offset; integrated into a
PLL achieving 66.2° phase margin, 10.47 MHz loop bandwidth, 3.82% peak overshoot, 0.12 μs settling time, with a reference
clock of 100 MHz and a divide-by-32 block
* Implemented a source-switched charge pump with current mismatch detection circuit, achieving 5.16% current mismatch over
a 0.2 V–0.9 V voltage swing; integrated with a third-order loop filter to achieve -69.6 dBc reference spurs, 0° phase error in
locked condition, and a PLL tuning range of 5%

*Project 2: High-performance Quadrature Clock Generator | Matlab, Cadence Virtuoso, 90 nm process*
* Designed a quadrature clock generator for a 2.5 pF load using delay-locked loop (DLL) and a phase interpolator, achieving
<1.8° phase error, 1 GHz operating frequency, <1 ps clock jitter, -40.9 dBc spurious tones, and -143.5 dBc/Hz phase noise at
1 MHz offset; demonstrated DLL lock time <0.5 μs, phase frequency detector (PFD) dead zone of 2.1 fs, phase interpolator
phase shift of 107.75°, and charge pump power consumption of 230 μW
